## Deploying the stack
* Clone the repository
* Open a terminal and configure the bucket name of your target Amazon S3 distribution bucket and region where you'd like to deploy
```
export SOLUTION_NAME={{cookiecutter.project_name}}
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=<S3 bucket to deploy the solution>
export VERSION=1.0.0
export AWS_REGION={{cookiecutter.aws_region}}
```
_Note:_ You have to manually create an S3 bucket with the name "$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$AWS_REGION"; 

* Next make the deploy script executable and run it
```
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./deploy.sh  \n
./deploy.sh
```
